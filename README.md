# Weather Dashboard


## Description 

For this project, I had to create a weather app that displayed the current weather and 5-day forecast for the city I searched for. The searches would then be saved under the input field and to local storage so that if I reloaded the page, previous searches would be displayed and clicking on them would populate the weather data.

## Usage 

In order to access this application, the user can click on the link below, which will redirect them to my Weather Dashboard application.

* [Weather Dashboard](https://kreid333.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

From there, the user can type in the name of a city and two things will populate onto the page: the current weather and a 5-day forceast. If the user refreshes the page, his searches are saved and, if clicked, they will populate the same two things as before.
